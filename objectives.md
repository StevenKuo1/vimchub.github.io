## Key outputs and overarching objectives

The Consortium aims to establish more efficient systems for vaccine impact estimates generation and is working with all the participating modelling groups to develop an online software, [Montagu](/montagu.vaccineimpact.org), which will enable them to easily access the latest input data and update their models. The platform will allow the funders to have quick access to the estimates and will ultimately have a publicly available interface with access to some of the data.  

The Consortium will provide the [funders](/partners/#funders) with major rounds of updated vaccine estimates in 2017, 2019 and 2021 for a specific disease portfolio.   

In addition, the Consortium serves as a resource to the funders on questions relating to vaccine impact modelling and ensures that the provided estimates have the most rigorous scientific foundation. During the five year period, the Consortium will aim to engage with four priority countries: Pakistan, India, Nigeria and Ethiopia to share the modelled estimates and to ensure that the used country-specific input data is accurate and up to date.
