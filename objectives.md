## Key outputs and overarching objectives

The Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium will provide the [funders](/partners/) with vaccine impact estimates for a specific disease portfolio. Major rounds of updated estimates will be produced in 2017, 2019 and 2021.

The Consortium will establish more efficient systems for impact estimates generation and is working with all the participating modelling groups to develop an online software, Montagu, which will enable them to easily access the latest input data and update their models. The platform will also allow the funders to have quick access to the estimates as well as ultimately have a publicly available interface to access some of the data.

The Consortium will serve as a resource to the funders on questions relating to vaccine impact modelling and ensure that the provided estimates have the most rigorous scientific foundation. Over the five years, the Consortium will aim to engage with four priority countries: Pakistan, India, Nigeria and Ethiopia (PINE countries) to share the modelled estimates and to ensure that the used country-specific input data is accurate and up to date.
