A generalised linear model was fitted to locations of reported yellow fever outbreaks or cases with anthropogenic and environmental covariates generating a risk map for yellow fever across Africa. It was then compared to the available serological data, primarily from central and eastern Africa, to assess the country-specific scale of under-reporting and obtain absolute estimates of transmission intensity in terms of a static force of infection or a basic reproduction number in a dynamical model, taking into account the population-level vaccination coverage through time. Burden and vaccine impact estimates were then generated by combining the transmission intensity with demographic information (population size and age distribution) and observed and hypothetical vaccination coverages in any given location and year.
