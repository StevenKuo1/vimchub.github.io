**Model name:** Japanese Encephalitis (JE) model (model under development)  
**Modellers:** [Hannah Clapham](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hannah_Clapham)   
**Institution:** [Oxford University Clinical Research (OUCRU), Vietnam](https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/vietnam-oucru)

This Japanese Encephalitis (JE) model will use a simple transmission model to estimate the impact of vaccination on JE cases. First, the relationship between currently available case data (and subsequently serological data), and environmental, climatic, animal covariates will be modelled. It will then be used to estimate transmission intensity across Southeast Asia. A simple transmission model will then model the relationship between transmission intensity, vaccine usage and cases.  All models will be fitted in a Bayesian framework and uncertainty included in the output estimates by sampling from the posterior estimates.
